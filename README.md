This is a simple Battery Health checker app. It has a great user interface and even a non- technical person will get to understand his battery status quickly. It runs through the following categories and calculates the health within seconds.
    1.Temperature
    2.Voltage
    3.Capacity
    4.Overall health
    5.Overheating
    
With time I will be trying to put more criterias and also calculate the expected remaining battery life, which will be very useful for all sections of people.
