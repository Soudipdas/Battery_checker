This is a simple Battery Health checker app. It has a great user interface and even a non- technical person will get to understand his battery status quickly. It runs through the following categories and calculates the health within seconds. This infact is a great project if used widely with some rules ( It may control the carbon footprints coming from the phone --- a damaged battery emits much more carbon footprints than a normal one).<br/>
    1.Temperature<br/>
    2.Voltage<br/>
    3.Capacity<br/>
    4.Overall health<br/>
    5.Overheating<br/>
    
With time I will be trying to put more criterias and also calculate the expected remaining battery life, which will be very useful for all sections of people.
